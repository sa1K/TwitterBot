# TwitterBot
A bot that tweets what songs I am listening to in Spotify
This bot requires both keys from spotify and twitter. If you need a key, use a developer account and place the spotify keys in a file called SpotAuth.py and the
twitter keys in a file called auth.py

Unfortunatly due to recent changes by Twitter the bot is no longer active.
